# multiscale_dev_dynamics

This repo contains code for analysing whole brain, single cell neuronal activity from larval zebrafish over development (3,4,5,6,7,8 day post fertilisation). The modules uses reservoir computing, and FORCE learning approaches the model neuronal connections and perturb dynamics. 

This is a work in progress.
